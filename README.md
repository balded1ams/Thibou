This repository is a french school project made by 7 university students. 

It is an application for those who want to visit museums while not having the time to do so. Users select what they want to see and the application makes a custom path for them where they can see everything they want. They can also see the details of what they are looking at and save their path for later. 

It is done with the NextJS support. We're using typescript for the back-end and both HTML and Tailwind CSS for the front-end. 

Unfortunately, since obtaining a real museum's consent is difficult, we use a fictional one.
